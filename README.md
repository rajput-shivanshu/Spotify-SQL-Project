# Spotify-SQL-Project

This project includes a series of SQL queries designed to extract unique information from a simulated Spotify database.

## Purpose

The Spotify SQL Project explores and understands the data of a typical music store using SQL queries. The queries seek to answer key questions about Spotify's operations, client behaviors, and sales, providing valuable insights that can help the company grow and enhance profitability.

## Data

The database contains various tables that store the data. According to the queries, some of the tables are: employee, invoice, customer, invoice_line, track, genre, artist, album.

## Analysis Approach:

The project is segmented into three tiers of complexity: Easy, Moderate, and Advanced.

  * Easy Level: Includes basic searches focused on direct data retrieval, such as identifying top customers or employees.
  * Moderate Level: Encompasses intermediate queries that dig deeper, using complex JOIN operations, GROUP BY clauses, and aggregate functions like SUM and COUNT to derive more nuanced insights.
  * Advanced Level: Showcases the power of advanced SQL techniques. It prominently uses Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and window functions like ROW_NUMBER to answer complex queries.

## SQL Constructs Used:

The project showcases a wide range of SQL constructs to address various querying needs:

  * Data Retrieval: SELECT, DISTINCT, and FROM.
  * Filtering: WHERE, IN, and LIMIT.
  * Aggregation: SUM, COUNT, AVG.
  * Sorting: ORDER BY.
  * Joining Tables: JOIN.
  * Grouping Data: GROUP BY.
  * Window Functions: ROW_NUMBER.
  * Subqueries and Derived Tables: WITH (for CTEs).
